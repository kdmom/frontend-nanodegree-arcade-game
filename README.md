for self-checking their submission.

The object of the game is to cross the block road to the water without getting hit by a bug.  Once you reach the water the player is reset to the beginning and you can try to cross again.

If you are hit by a bug the player is reset back to start and ready to attempt to cross again.   The bugs will not go in the grass so you are safe there.

Good Luck!
